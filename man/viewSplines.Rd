\title{Plot spline curves}
\usage{
viewSplines(knots, degree, theta)
}
\arguments{
\item{knots}{A vector of values between 0 and 1, specifying cut-points for splines}

\item{degree}{Integer specifying degree of curvature.}

\item{theta}{A vector or matrix of values between 0 and 1. Each column of the matrix
represents the weights/coefficients that will be applied to the basis functions
determined by the knots and degree. Each column of theta represents a separate
spline curve.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object that contains a plot of the spline curves. The number of
spline curves in the plot will equal the number of columns in the matrix (or it
will equal 1 if theta is a vector).
}

knots <- c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)
theta1 = c(0.1, 0.8, 0.4, 0.9, 0.2, 1.0)
