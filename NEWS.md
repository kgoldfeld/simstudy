# simstudy (development version)

# simstudy 0.3.0

## New features
* You can now use non-scalar variables with double-dot notation. See the [*Dynamic Data Definition*](https://kgoldfeld.github.io/simstudy/articles/double_dot_extension.html#using-non-scalar-double-dot-variable-reference-1) Vignette.
* The 'categorical' distribution now supports the variance parameter to introduce categories other than 1...n.
* You can now use [trtAssign()] as a distribution with [defData()].
   
## Minor improvements and fixes
* Added CITATION
* genData now warns that a set 'id' parameter will override previously defined 'id' names from the data definition.
* genData now handles NULL as 'id' value in data definitions (e.g. when definitions are not created via defData etc.) by defaulting to 'id'.
* Fix an error in genOrdCat when only a single adjustment variable is given but
  more than one new category will be created.
* Fix a bug where ..variables did not work within a function using the `dist="beta"`.  

# simstudy 0.2.2
* Improve documentation and vignettes.

# simstudy 0.2.1
* Add 'backports' for compatibility with R < 4.0 
* Fix a bug on R < 4.0 in genOrdCat
* Current version is now only compatible with R version >= 3.3.0

# simstudy 0.2.0

## Deprecated Functions
* Moved genCorOrdCat's functionality into genOrdCat. genCorOrdCat is now
  deprecated.
* Renamed catProbs to genCatFormula for naming consistency. catProbs is now
  deprecated. 

## New features
* Introduced a new system for formula definitions and completely reworked the
  underlying code. See vignette "Dynamic Data Definition".
* The new function genMixFormula generates mixture formulas from different
  inputs.
* Some simstudy functions now produce custom errors and warnings. Eventually
  all conditions will be replaced by the new system to make error handling
  easier for the user.
* Added new vignettes.
* Created documentation pages for: 
   - the release version https://kgoldfeld.github.io/simstudy/
   - and development version https://kgoldfeld.github.io/simstudy/dev

## Minor improvements and fixes
* genCatFormula now warns if an additional category is created or probabilities
  are normalized.

* Fixed bug in trtAssign when strata had count of one.
* defData now also checks the first row in the definition table for validity.
