Description: Simulates data sets in order to explore modeling
    techniques or better understand data generating processes. The user
    specifies a set of relationships between covariates, and generates
    data based on these specifications. The final data sets can represent
    data from randomized control trials, repeated measure (longitudinal)
    designs, and cluster randomized trials. Missingness can be generated
    using various mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, NMAR).
